# **"Hear Me" Landing Page**

This is a simple static website that serves as the official landing page for the "Hear Me" project.

It is designed to be hosted on the **Firebase Hosting** platform and is built using **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive design.

## **üåü Key Features**

* **Home Page (`index.html`):** The primary page that introduces visitors to our project, vision, features, and pricing.
* **Component-Based Structure:** Shared elements like the header and footer are loaded from the `/components` directory via JavaScript for easy maintenance.
* **Separate Pages:** Additional pages (like `coming-soon.html`) are organized in the `/pages` directory.
* **Maintenance Page (`maintenance.html`):** A temporary page to display during scheduled maintenance, complete with a countdown timer.
* **Custom 404 Page (`404.html`):** A user-friendly "Not Found" page.
* **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Contains shared logic, including the mobile menu toggle for index.html, loading header/footer and the countdown timer for `maintenance.html`.
* **Custom Styles (`style.css`):** A minimal stylesheet primarily used for custom animations (like the spinning gear on the maintenance page).
* **Responsive Design:** The site uses Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive layout.

## **üõ†Ô∏è How to Test Locally**

This project is configured to work with **Firebase Hosting**. You can easily run a local server to test all pages before deploying them.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the **Firebase CLI** (Command Line Tools) installed.

If you don't have it, install it globally via `npm`:
```bash
npm install \-g firebase-tools
```

### **Running the Local Server**

1. **Log in to Firebase:** (This step might be optional for firebase serve, but it's good practice).
```bash
    firebase login
```

2. **Run the server:** While in the project's root directory (where firebase.json is located), execute the following command:
```bash
    firebase serve
```

3. **Open the site in your browser:** After running the command, the terminal will show you a local address. By default, it is: `http://localhost:5000`
   * Main page: `http://localhost:5000` (or `http://localhost:5000/index.html`)
   * Maintenance page: `http://localhost:5000/maintenance.html`
   * 404 Page: Navigate to any non-existent URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/test`)

## **üöÄ Deployment**

Deployment is handled automatically.

Any push or pull request merge to the `main` branch will trigger an automatic deployment to Firebase Hosting.
